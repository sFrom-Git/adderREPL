# adderREPL
simple mock REPL just for fun.

quit										-Exit the REPL
input var 							-Prompt for and allow the user to enter a value for the variable
print val 							-Print the value val
var gets val 						-Variable var is assigned the value val
var adds val 						-Variable var has the value val added to it
 
WHERE:
var is always a variable name that contains only letters; and
val can be either:
	-A variable name that contains only letters; or
	-A natural number that contains only digits



Interpreter
===========
This is a very limited interpreter that can read a file that
contains the following commands:

quit										-Exit the REPL
input var 							-Prompt for and allow the user to enter a value for the variable
print val 							-Print the value val
var gets val 						-Variable var is assigned the value val
var adds val 						-Variable var has the value val added to it
 
WHERE:
var is always a variable name that contains only letters; and
val can be either:

	-A natural number that contains only digits

To test the interpreter a file named 'apples.ad' has been provided.
